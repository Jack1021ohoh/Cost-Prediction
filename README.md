# Cost-Prediction

---
### Description
This project involves regression analysis using customer data, which was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Media Campaign Cost Prediction dataset. I applied machine learning models, including RandomForest and XGBoost, to predict customer costs. A key aspect of this exercise was the use of the Optuna package for hyperparameter optimization, which significantly enhanced the performance of the models.
