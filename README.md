# Cost-Prediction

---
### Description
This is a regression exercise using customer data. The dataset was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Media Campaign Cost Prediction dataset. I used machine learning models, such as RandomForest, XGBoost, to predict costs of customers. The most interesting part of this exercise is that I used Optuna package to optimize models' hyperparameters.
